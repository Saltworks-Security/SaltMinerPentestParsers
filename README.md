# SaltMinerPentestParsers
## A collection of parsers used to convert other tools output into a format that is importable by SaltMiner's PenTest module

This project is built so that the user of the Saltminer Pentest Module can take their issue files from any tool that they use and convert it into a 
Saltminer Pentest friendly format. The end file will be able to be uploaded directly into the 'import issues' tab on the engagement. I have also started
to add functionality that will allow the user to convert a file that will import their custom templated issues. 

## User instructions 
The user will need to download this project onto their machine and will need to access the project commands through the CLI. 
First you will add your document that you want to convert to the folder named "inputDirectory". 
Then from the CLI you will need to navigate to the project folder or project working directory. 
If this is your first time using the project you will need to install the requirements.txt file:

pip install -r /projectDirectory/requirements.txt

Then the CLI command syntax is as such: 

myCommandLine@CLI ~ % python3 runner.py VENDOR_NAME PATH_TO_CONVERTING_FILE DESTINATION_FILE_FOLDER

VENDOR_NAME = the vendor of what you used to get the issue file i.e. burp, pwnDoc, veraCode... 
    Current Vendor List: Burp, Nessus, PwnDoc, Nmap

PATH_TO_CONVERTING_FILE = The path to the file you want to convert. ./inputDirectory/fileIWantToConvert

DESTINATION_FILE_FOLDER = The path to the destination file folder, or where you want the converted file to go. ./destinationDirectory/
    If you want it in the same folder as the project directory just type ".".

## Want to make your own importer?

Instructions coming soon... 

## Known Issues 
If you decide to make the DESTINATION_FILE_FOLDER the same directory as the PATH_TO_CONVERTING_FILE and the file to be converted is a json file the converter will
overwrite your original file as they will have the same name and file type.
